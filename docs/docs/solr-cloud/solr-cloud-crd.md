# The SolrCloud CRD

The SolrCloud CRD allows users to spin up a Solr cloud in a very configurable way.
Those configuration options are laid out on this page.

## Solr Options

The SolrCloud CRD gives users the ability to customize how Solr is run.

Please note that the options described below are shown using the base SolrCloud resource, not the helm chart.
Most options will have the same name and path, however there are differences such as `customSolrKubeOptions`.
If using Helm, refer to the [Helm Chart documentation](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/apache-solr/solr#chart-values) to see the names for the options you are looking to use.
This document should still be used to see how the SolrCloud options can be used.

### Solr Modules and Additional Libraries
_Since v0.5.0_

Solr comes packaged with modules that can be loaded optionally, known as either Solr Modules or Solr Contrib Modules.
By default they are not included in the classpath of Solr, so they have to be explicitly enabled.
Use the **`SolrCloud.spec.solrModules`** property to add a list of module names, not paths, and they will automatically be enabled for the solrCloud.

However, users might want to include custom code that is not an official Solr Module.
In order to facilitate this, the **`SolrCloud.spec.additionalLibs`** property takes a list of paths to folders, containing jars to load in the classpath of the SolrCloud.

## Data Storage

The SolrCloud CRD gives the option for users to use either
persistent storage, through [PVCs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/),
or ephemeral storage, through [emptyDir volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir),
to store Solr data.
Ephemeral and persistent storage cannot be used together, if both are provided, the `persistent` options take precedence.
If neither is provided, ephemeral storage will be used by default.

These options can be found in `SolrCloud.spec.dataStorage`

- **`persistent`**
  - **`reclaimPolicy`** -
    _Since v0.2.7_ -
    Either `Retain`, the default, or `Delete`.
    This describes the lifecycle of PVCs that are deleted after the SolrCloud is deleted, or the SolrCloud is scaled down and the pods that the PVCs map to no longer exist.
    `Retain` is used by default, as that is the default Kubernetes policy, to leave PVCs in case pods, or StatefulSets are deleted accidentally.
    
    Note: If reclaimPolicy is set to `Delete`, PVCs will not be deleted if pods are merely deleted. They will only be deleted once the `SolrCloud.spec.replicas` is scaled down or deleted.
  - **`pvcTemplate`** - The template of the PVC to use for the solr data PVCs. By default the name will be "data".
    Only the `pvcTemplate.spec` field is required, metadata is optional.
    
    Note: This template cannot be changed unless the SolrCloud is deleted and recreated.
    This is a [limitation of StatefulSets and PVCs in Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/661).
- **`ephemeral`**

  There are two types of ephemeral volumes that can be specified.
  Both are optional, and if none are specified then an empty `emptyDir` volume source is used.
  If both are specified then the `hostPath` volume source will take precedence.
  - **`emptyDir`** - An [`emptyDir` volume source](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) that describes the desired emptyDir volume to use in each SolrCloud pod to store data.
  - **`hostPath`** - A [`hostPath` volume source](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath) that describes the desired hostPath volume to use in each SolrCloud pod to store data.

## Update Strategy
_Since v0.2.7_

The SolrCloud CRD provides users the ability to define how Pod updates should be managed, through `SolrCloud.Spec.updateStrategy`.
This provides the following options:

Under `SolrCloud.Spec.updateStrategy`:

- **`method`** - The method in which Solr pods should be updated. Enum options are as follows:
  - `Managed` - (Default) The Solr Operator will take control over deleting pods for updates. This process is [documented here](managed-updates.md).
  - `StatefulSet` - Use the default StatefulSet rolling update logic, one pod at a time waiting for all pods to be "ready".
  - `Manual` - Neither the StatefulSet or the Solr Operator will delete pods in need of an update. The user will take responsibility over this.
- **`managed`** - Options for rolling updates managed by the Solr Operator.
  - **`maxPodsUnavailable`** - (Defaults to `"25%"`) The number of Solr pods in a Solr Cloud that are allowed to be unavailable during the rolling restart.
  More pods may become unavailable during the restart, however the Solr Operator will not kill pods if the limit has already been reached.  
  - **`maxShardReplicasUnavailable`** - (Defaults to `1`) The number of replicas for each shard allowed to be unavailable during the restart.
- **`restartSchedule`** - A [CRON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) schedule for automatically restarting the Solr Cloud.
  [Multiple CRON syntaxes](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3?utm_source=godoc#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format) are supported, such as intervals (e.g. `@every 10h`) or predefined schedules (e.g. `@yearly`, `@weekly`, etc.).

**Note:** Both `maxPodsUnavailable` and `maxShardReplicasUnavailable` are intOrString fields. So either an int or string can be provided for the field.
- **int** - The parameter is treated as an absolute value, unless the value is <= 0 which is interpreted as unlimited.
- **string** - Only percentage string values (`"0%"` - `"100%"`) are accepted, all other values will be ignored.
  - **`maxPodsUnavailable`** - The `maximumPodsUnavailable` is calculated as the percentage of the total pods configured for that Solr Cloud.
  - **`maxShardReplicasUnavailable`** - The `maxShardReplicasUnavailable` is calculated independently for each shard, as the percentage of the number of replicas for that shard.

## Addressability
_Since v0.2.6_

The SolrCloud CRD provides users the ability to define how it is addressed, through the following options:

Under `SolrCloud.Spec.solrAddressability`:

- **`podPort`** - The port on which the pod is listening. This is also that the port that the Solr Jetty service will listen on. (Defaults to `8983`)
- **`commonServicePort`** - The port on which the common service is exposed. (Defaults to `80`)
- **`kubeDomain`** - Specifies an override of the default Kubernetes cluster domain name, `cluster.local`. This option should only be used if the Kubernetes cluster has been setup with a custom domain name.
- **`external`** - Expose the cloud externally, outside of the kubernetes cluster in which it is running.
  - **`method`** - (Required) The method by which your cloud will be exposed externally.
  Currently available options are [`Ingress`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) and [`ExternalDNS`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns).
  The goal is to support more methods in the future, such as LoadBalanced Services.
  - **`domainName`** - (Required) The primary domain name to open your cloud endpoints on. If `useExternalAddress` is set to `true`, then this is the domain that will be used in Solr Node names.
  - **`additionalDomainNames`** - You can choose to listen on additional domains for each endpoint, however Solr will not register itself under these names.
  - **`useExternalAddress`** - Use the external address to advertise the SolrNode. If a domain name is required for the chosen external `method`, then the one provided in `domainName` will be used. \
    This can not be set to `true` when **`hideNodes`** is set to `true` or **`ingressTLSTermination`** is used.
  - **`hideCommon`** - Do not externally expose the common service (one endpoint for all solr nodes).
  - **`hideNodes`** - Do not externally expose each node. (This cannot be set to `true` if the cloud is running across multiple kubernetes clusters)
  - **`nodePortOverride`** - Make the Node Service(s) override the podPort. This is only available for the `Ingress` external method. If `hideNodes` is set to `true`, then this option is ignored. If provided, this port will be used to advertise the Solr Node. \
    If `method: Ingress` and `hideNodes: false`, then this value defaults to `80` since that is the default port that ingress controllers listen on.
  - **`ingressTLSTermination`** - Terminate TLS for the SolrCloud at the `Ingress`, if using the `Ingress` **method**. This will leave the inter-node communication within the cluster to use HTTP. \
    This option may not be used with **`useExternalAddress`**. Only one sub-option can be provided.
    - **`useDefaultTLSSecret`** - Use the default TLS Secret set by your Ingress controller, if your Ingress controller supports this feature. Cannot be used when `tlsSecret` is used. \
      For example, using nginx: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/tls/#default-ssl-certificate
    - **`tlsSecret`** - Name a of Kubernetes TLS Secret to terminate TLS when using the `Ingress` method. Cannot be used when `useDefaultTlsSecret` is used.

**Note:** Unless both `external.method=Ingress` and `external.hideNodes=false`, a headless service will be used to make each Solr Node in the statefulSet addressable.
If both of those criteria are met, then an individual ClusterIP Service will be created for each Solr Node/Pod.

If you are using an `Ingress` for external addressability, you can customize the created `Ingress` through `SolrCloud.spec.customSolrKubeOptions.ingressOptions`.
Under this property, you can set custom `annotations`, `labels` and an `ingressClassName`.

## Backups

Solr Backups are enabled via the Solr Operator.
Please refer to the [SolrBackup documentation](../solr-backup) for more information on setting up a SolrCloud with backups enabled.

## Zookeeper Reference

Solr Clouds require an Apache Zookeeper to connect to.

The Solr operator gives a few options.

- Connecting to an already running zookeeper ensemble via [connection strings](#zk-connection-info)
- [Spinning up a provided](#provided-instance) Zookeeper Ensemble in the same namespace via the [Zookeeper Operator](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator)

These options are configured under `spec.zookeeperRef`

#### Chroot

Both options below come with options to specify a `chroot`, or a ZNode path for solr to use as it's base "directory" in Zookeeper.
Before the operator creates or updates a StatefulSet with a given `chroot`, it will first ensure that the given ZNode path exists and if it doesn't the operator will create all necessary ZNodes in the path.
If no chroot is given, a default of `/` will be used, which doesn't require the existence check previously mentioned.
If a chroot is provided without a prefix of `/`, the operator will add the prefix, as it is required by Zookeeper.

### ZK Connection Info

This is an external/internal connection string as well as an optional chRoot to an already running Zookeeeper ensemble.
If you provide an external connection string, you do not _have_ to provide an internal one as well.

Under `spec.zookeeperRef`:

- **`connectionInfo`**
  - **`externalConnectionString`** - The ZK connection string to the external Zookeeper cluster, e.g. `zoo1:2181`
  - **`chroot`** - The chroot to use for the cluster

External ZooKeeper clusters are often configured to use ZooKeeper features (e.g. securePort) which require corresponding configuration on the client side.
To support these use-cases, users may provide arbitrary system properties under `spec.solrZkOpts` which will be passed down to all ZooKeeper clients (Solr, zkcli.sh, etc.) managed by the operator.

#### ACLs
_Since v0.2.7_

The Solr Operator allows for users to specify ZK ACL references in their Solr Cloud CRDs.
The user must specify the name of a secret that resides in the same namespace as the cloud, that contains an ACL username value and an ACL password value.
This ACL must have admin permissions for the [chroot](#chroot) given.

The ACL information can be provided through an ADMIN acl and a READ ONLY acl.  
- Admin: `SolrCloud.spec.zookeeperRef.connectionInfo.acl`
- Read Only: `SolrCloud.spec.zookeeperRef.connectionInfo.readOnlyAcl`

All ACL fields are **required** if an ACL is used.

- **`secret`** - The name of the secret, in the same namespace as the SolrCloud, that contains the admin ACL username and password.
- **`usernameKey`** - The name of the key in the provided secret that stores the admin ACL username.
- **`passwordKey`** - The name of the key in the provided secret that stores the admin ACL password.

### Provided Instance

If you do not require the Solr cloud to run cross-kube cluster, and do not want to manage your own Zookeeper ensemble,
the solr-operator can manage Zookeeper ensemble(s) for you.

Using the [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator), a new Zookeeper ensemble can be spun up for 
each solrCloud that has this option specified.

The startup parameter `zookeeper-operator` must be provided on startup of the solr-operator for this parameter to be available.

To find all Provided zookeeper options, run `kubectl explain solrcloud.spec.zookeeperRef.provided`.
Zookeeper Conf and PodOptions provided in the linked Zookeeper Operator version should be supported in the SolrCloud CRD.
However, this is a manual task, so not all options might be available.
If there is an option available in the ZookeeperCluster CRD that is not exposed via the SolrCloud CRD, please create a Github Issue.

#### Zookeeper Storage Options
_Since v0.4.0_

The Zookeeper Operator allows for both ephemeral and persistent storage, and the Solr Operator supports both as of `v0.4.0`.

```yaml
spec:
  zookeeperRef:
    provided:
      ephemeral:
        emptydirvolumesource: {}
      persistence:
        reclaimPolicy: "Retain" # Either Retain or Delete
        spec: {} # PVC Spec for the Zookeeper volumes
```

By default, if you do not provide either `ephemeral` or `persistence`, the Solr Operator will default to the type of storage you are using for your Solr pods.

However, if you provide either object above, even if the object is empty, that storage type will be used for the created Zookeeper pods.
If both `ephemeral` and `persistence` is provided, then `persistence` is preferred.

#### ACLs for Provided Ensembles
_Since v0.3.0_

If you want Solr to set ZK ACLs for znodes it creates in the `provided` ensemble, you can supply ACL credentials for an ADMIN and optionally a READ ONLY user using the following config settings: 
- Admin: `SolrCloud.spec.zookeeperRef.provided.acl`
- Read Only: `SolrCloud.spec.zookeeperRef.provided.readOnlyAcl`

All ACL fields are **required** if an ACL is used.

- **`secret`** - The name of the secret, in the same namespace as the SolrCloud, that contains the ACL username and password.
- **`usernameKey`** - The name of the key in the provided secret that stores the admin ACL username.
- **`passwordKey`** - The name of the key in the provided secret that stores the admin ACL password.

**Warning**: There is a known issue with the Zookeeper operator where it deploys pods with `skipACL=yes`, see: https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator/issues/316.
This means that even if Solr sets the ACLs on znodes, they will not be enforced by Zookeeper. If your organization requires Solr to use ZK ACLs, then you'll need to 
deploy Zookeeper to Kubernetes using another approach, such as using a Helm chart. 

## Override Built-in Solr Configuration Files
_Since v0.2.7_

The Solr operator deploys well-configured SolrCloud instances with minimal input required from human operators. 
As such, the operator installs various configuration files automatically, including `solr.xml` for node-level settings and `log4j2.xml` for logging. 
However, there may come a time when you need to override the built-in configuration files with custom settings.

In general, users can provide custom config files by providing a ConfigMap in the same namespace as the SolrCloud instance; 
all custom config files should be stored in the same user-provided ConfigMap under different keys.
Point your SolrCloud definition to a user-provided ConfigMap using the following structure:
```yaml
spec:
  ...
  customSolrKubeOptions:
    configMapOptions:
      providedConfigMap: <Custom-ConfigMap-Here>
```

### Custom solr.xml

Solr pods load node-level configuration settings from `/var/solr/data/solr.xml`. 
This important configuration file gets created by the `cp-solr-xml` initContainer which bootstraps the `solr.home` directory on each pod before starting the main container.
The default `solr.xml` is mounted into the `cp-solr-xml` initContainer from a ConfigMap named `<INSTANCE>-solrcloud-configmap` (where `<INSTANCE>` is the name of your SolrCloud instance) created by the Solr operator.

_Note: The data in the default ConfigMap is not editable! Any changes to the `solr.xml` in the default ConfigMap created by the operator will be overwritten during the next reconcile cycle._

Many of the specific values in `solr.xml` can be set using Java system properties; for instance, the following setting controls the read timeout for the HTTP client used by Solr's `HttpShardHandlerFactory`:
```xml
<int name="socketTimeout">${socketTimeout:600000}</int>
```
The `${socketTimeout:600000}` syntax means pull the value from a Java system property named `socketTimeout` with default `600000` if not set.

You can set Java system properties using the `solrOpts` string in your SolrCloud definition, such as:
```yaml
spec:
  solrOpts: -DsocketTimeout=300000
```
This same approach works for a number of settings in `solrconfig.xml` as well.

However, if you need to customize `solr.xml` beyond what can be accomplished with Java system properties, 
then you need to supply your own `solr.xml` in a ConfigMap in the same namespace where you deploy your SolrCloud instance.
Provide your custom XML in the ConfigMap using `solr.xml` as the key as shown in the example below:
```yaml
---
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: custom-solr-xml
data:
  solr.xml: |
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <solr>
      ... CUSTOM CONFIG HERE ...
    </solr>
```
**Important: Your custom `solr.xml` must include `<int name="hostPort">${hostPort:0}</int>` as the operator relies on this element to set the port Solr pods advertise to ZooKeeper. If this element is missing, then your Solr pods will not be created.**

You can get the default `solr.xml` from a Solr pod as a starting point for creating a custom config using `kubectl cp` as shown in the example below:
```bash
SOLR_POD_ID=$(kubectl get pod -l technology=solr-cloud --no-headers -o custom-columns=":metadata.name" | head -1)
kubectl cp $SOLR_POD_ID:/var/solr/data/solr.xml ./custom-solr.xml
```
This copies the default config from the first Solr pod found in the namespace and names it `custom-solr.xml`. Customize the settings in `custom-solr.xml` as needed and then create a ConfigMap using YAML. 

_Note: Using `kubectl create configmap --from-file` scrambles the XML formatting, so we recommend defining the configmap YAML as shown above to keep the XML formatted properly._

Point your SolrCloud instance at the custom ConfigMap using:
```yaml
spec:
  customSolrKubeOptions:
    configMapOptions:
      providedConfigMap: custom-solr-xml
```
_Note: If you set `providedConfigMap`, then the ConfigMap must include the `solr.xml` or `log4j2.xml` key, otherwise the SolrCloud will fail to reconcile._

#### Changes to Custom Config Trigger Rolling Restarts

The Solr operator stores the MD5 hash of your custom XML in the StatefulSet's pod spec annotations (`spec.template.metadata.annotations`). To see the current annotations for your Solr pods, you can do:
```bash
kubectl annotate pod -l technology=solr-cloud --list=true
```
If the custom `solr.xml` changes in the user-provided ConfigMap, then the operator triggers a rolling restart of Solr pods to apply the updated configuration settings automatically.

To summarize, if you need to customize `solr.xml`, provide your own version in a ConfigMap and changes made to the XML in the ConfigMap are automatically applied to your Solr pods.

### Custom Log Configuration
_Since v0.3.0_

By default, the Solr Docker image configures Solr to load its log configuration from `/var/solr/log4j2.xml`. 
If you need to fine-tune the log configuration, then you can provide a custom `log4j2.xml` in a ConfigMap using the same basic process as described in the previous section for customizing `solr.xml`. If supplied, the operator overrides the log config using the `LOG4J_PROPS` env var.

As with custom `solr.xml`, the operator can track the MD5 hash of your `log4j2.xml` in the pod spec annotations to trigger a rolling restart if the log config changes. 
However, Log4j2 supports hot reloading of log configuration using the `monitorInterval` attribute on the root `<Configuration>` element. For more information on this, see: [Log4j Automatic Reconfiguration](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#AutomaticReconfiguration). 
If your custom log config has a `monitorInterval` set, then the operator does not watch for changes to the log config and will not trigger a rolling restart if the config changes. 
Kubernetes will automatically update the file on each pod's filesystem when the data in the ConfigMap changes. Once Kubernetes updates the file, Log4j will pick up the changes and apply them without restarting the Solr pod.

If you need to customize both `solr.xml` and `log4j2.xml` then you need to supply both in the same ConfigMap using multiple keys as shown below:
```yaml
---
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: custom-solr-xml
data:
  log4j2.xml: |
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Configuration monitorInterval="30">
     ... YOUR CUSTOM LOG4J CONFIG HERE ...
    </Configuration>


  solr.xml: |
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <solr>
     ... YOUR CUSTOM SOLR XML CONFIG HERE ...
    </solr>
```

## Enable TLS Between Solr Pods
_Since v0.3.0_

A common approach to securing traffic to your Solr cluster is to perform [**TLS termination** at the Ingress](#enable-ingress-tls-termination) and leave all traffic between Solr pods un-encrypted.
However, depending on how you expose Solr on your network, you may also want to encrypt traffic between Solr pods.
The Solr operator provides **optional** configuration settings to enable TLS for encrypting traffic between Solr pods.

Enabling TLS for Solr is a straight-forward process once you have a [**PKCS12 keystore**]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12)) containing an [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) certificate and private key; as of Java 8, PKCS12 is the default keystore format supported by the JVM.

There are three basic use cases supported by the Solr operator. First, you can use cert-manager to issue a certificate and store the resulting PKCS12 keystore in a Kubernetes TLS secret. 
Alternatively, you can create the TLS secret manually from a certificate obtained by some other means. In both cases, you simply point your SolrCloud CRD to the resulting TLS secret and corresponding keystore password secret.
Lastly, as of **v0.4.0**, you can supply the path to a directory containing TLS files that are mounted by some external agent or CSI driver.  

### Use cert-manager to issue the certificate

[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) is a popular Kubernetes controller for managing TLS certificates, including renewing certificates prior to expiration. 
One of the primary benefits of cert-manager is it supports pluggable certificate `Issuer` implementations, including a self-signed Issuer for local development and an [ACME compliant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555) Issuer for working with services like [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

If you already have a TLS certificate you want to use for Solr, then you don't need cert-manager and can skip down to [I already have a TLS Certificate](#i-already-have-a-tls-certificate) later in this section.
If you do not have a TLS certificate, then we recommend installing **cert-manager** as it makes working with TLS in Kubernetes much easier.

#### Install cert-manager

Given its popularity, cert-manager may already be installed in your Kubernetes cluster. To check if `cert-manager` is already installed, do:
```bash
kubectl get crds -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=cert-manager
```
If installed, you should see the following cert-manager related CRDs:
```
certificaterequests.cert-manager.io
certificates.cert-manager.io
challenges.acme.cert-manager.io
clusterissuers.cert-manager.io
issuers.cert-manager.io
orders.acme.cert-manager.io
```

If not installed, use Helm to install it into the `cert-manager` namespace:
```bash
if ! helm repo list | grep -q "https://charts.jetstack.io"; then
  helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
  helm repo update
fi

kubectl create ns cert-manager
helm upgrade --install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --version v1.1.0 \
  --set installCRDs=true
``` 
You’ll need admin privileges to install the CRDs in a shared K8s cluster, so work with your friendly Kubernetes admin to install if needed (most likely cert-manager will already be installed).
Refer to the [cert-manager Installation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) instructions for more information.

#### Create cert-manager Certificate

Once cert-manager is installed, you need to create an `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` CRD and then request a certificate using a [Certificate CRD](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/).
Refer to the [cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) on how to define a certificate.

Certificate Issuers are typically platform specific. For instance, on GKE, to create a Let’s Encrypt Issuer you need a service account with various cloud DNS permissions granted for DNS01 challenges to work, see: https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/google/.

The DNS names in your certificate should match the Solr addressability settings in your SolrCloud CRD. For instance, if your SolrCloud CRD uses the following settings:
```yaml
spec:
  solrAddressability:
    external:
      domainName: k8s.solr.cloud
``` 
Then your certificate needs the following domains specified:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  dnsNames:
  - '*.k8s.solr.cloud'
  - k8s.solr.cloud
```
The wildcard DNS name will cover all SolrCloud nodes such as `<NS>-solrcloud-1.k8s.solr.cloud`.

Also, when requesting your certificate, keep in mind that internal DNS names in Kubernetes are not valid for public certificates. 
For instance `<svc>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local` is internal to Kubernetes and certificate issuer services like LetsEncrypt 
will not generate a certificate for K8s internal DNS names (you'll get errors during certificate issuing).

Another benefit is cert-manager can create a [PKCS12](https://cert-manager.io/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.15/#general-availability-of-jks-and-pkcs-12-keystores) keystore automatically when issuing a `Certificate`, 
which allows the Solr operator to mount the keystore directly on our Solr pods. Ensure your certificate instance requests **pkcs12 keystore** gets created using config similar to the following:
```yaml
  keystores:
    pkcs12:
      create: true
      passwordSecretRef:
        key: password-key
        name: pkcs12-password-secret
```
_Note: the example structure above goes in your certificate CRD YAML, not SolrCloud._

You need to create the keystore secret (e.g. `pkcs12-password-secret`) in the same namespace before requesting the certificate, see: https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/api-docs/#cert-manager.io/v1.PKCS12Keystore.
Although a keystore password is not required for PKCS12, **cert-manager** requires a password when requesting a `pkcs12` keystore for your certificate.
Moreover, most JVMs require a password for pkcs12 keystores, not supplying a password typically results in errors like the following:
```
Caused by: java.security.UnrecoverableKeyException: Get Key failed: null
	at java.base/sun.security.pkcs12.PKCS12KeyStore.engineGetKey(Unknown Source)
	at java.base/sun.security.util.KeyStoreDelegator.engineGetKey(Unknown Source)
	at java.base/java.security.KeyStore.getKey(Unknown Source)
	at java.base/sun.security.ssl.SunX509KeyManagerImpl.<init>(Unknown Source)
```
Consequently, the Solr operator requires you to use a non-null password for your keystore. 

Here's an example of how to use cert-manager to generate a self-signed certificate:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pkcs12-password-secret
data:
  password-key: SOME_PASSWORD_HERE

---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}

---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-cert
spec:
  subject:
    organizations: ["dev"]
  dnsNames:
    - localhost
    - dev-dev-solrcloud.ing.local.domain
    - "*.ing.local.domain"
  secretName: dev-selfsigned-cert-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-issuer
  keystores:
    pkcs12:
      create: true
      passwordSecretRef:
        key: password-key
        name: pkcs12-password-secret
```

Once created, simply point the SolrCloud deployment at the TLS and keystore password secrets, e.g.
```yaml
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...

  solrTLS:
    keyStorePasswordSecret:
      name: pkcs12-password-secret
      key: password-key
    pkcs12Secret:
      name: selfsigned-cert
      key: keystore.p12
```
_Note: when using self-signed certificates, you'll have to configure HTTP client libraries to skip hostname and CA verification._

### I already have a TLS Certificate

Users may bring their own cert stored in a `kubernetes.io/tls` secret; for this use case, cert-manager is not required. 
There are many ways to get a certificate, such as from the GKE managed certificate process or from a CA directly. 
Regardless of how you obtain a Certificate, it needs to be stored in a [Kubernetes TLS secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets) 
that contains a `tls.crt` file (x.509 certificate with a public key and info about the issuer) and a `tls.key` file (the private key).

Ideally, the TLS secret will also have a `pkcs12` keystore. 
If the supplied TLS secret does not contain a `keystore.p12` key, then the Solr operator creates an `initContainer` on the StatefulSet to generate the keystore from the TLS secret using the following command:
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -in tls.crt -inkey tls.key -out keystore.p12 -passout pass:${SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD}"
```
_The `initContainer` uses the main Solr image as it has `openssl` installed._

Configure the SolrCloud deployment to point to the user-provided keystore and TLS secrets:
```yaml
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...

  solrTLS:
    keyStorePasswordSecret:
      name: pkcs12-keystore-manual
      key: password-key
    pkcs12Secret:
      name: pkcs12-keystore-manual
      key: keystore.p12
```

### Separate TrustStore

A truststore holds public keys for certificates you trust. By default, Solr pods are configured to use the keystore as the truststore.
However, you may have a separate truststore you want to use for Solr TLS. As with the keystore, you need to provide a PKCS12 truststore in a secret and then configure your SolrCloud TLS settings as shown below:
```yaml
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...

  solrTLS:
    keyStorePasswordSecret:
      name: pkcs12-keystore-manual
      key: password-key
    pkcs12Secret:
      name: pkcs12-keystore-manual
      key: keystore.p12
    trustStorePasswordSecret:
      name: pkcs12-truststore
      key: password-key
    trustStoreSecret:
      name: pkcs12-truststore
      key: truststore.p12
``` 
_Tip: if your truststore is not in PKCS12 format, use `openssl` to convert it._ 

### Mounted TLS Directory
_Since v0.4.0_

The options discussed to this point require that all Solr pods share the same certificate and truststore. An emerging pattern in the Kubernetes ecosystem is to issue a unique certificate for each pod.
Typically this operation is performed by an external agent, such as a cert-manager extension, that uses mutating webhooks to mount a unique certificate and supporting files on each pod dynamically.
How the pod-specific certificates get issued is beyond the scope of the Solr operator. Under this scheme, you can use `spec.solrTLS.mountedTLSDir.path` to specify the path where the TLS files are mounted on the main pod.
The following example illustrates how to configure a keystore and truststore in PKCS12 format using the `mountedTLSDir` option:
```yaml
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...

  solrTLS:
    clientAuth: Want
    checkPeerName: true
    verifyClientHostname: true
    mountedTLSDir:
      path: /pod-server-tls
      keystoreFile: keystore.p12
      keystorePasswordFile: keystore-password
      truststoreFile: truststore.p12
```

When using the mounted TLS directory option, you need to ensure each Solr pod gets restarted before the certificate expires. Solr does not support hot reloading of the keystore or truststore.
Consequently, we recommend using the `spec.updateStrategy.restartSchedule` to restart pods before the certificate expires. 
Typically, with this scheme, a new certificate is issued whenever a pod is restarted.

### Client TLS
_Since v0.4.0_

Solr supports using separate client and server TLS certificates. Solr uses the client certificate in mutual TLS (mTLS) scenarios to make requests to other Solr pods.
Use the `spec.solrClientTLS` configuration options to configure a separate client certificate. 
As this is an advanced option, the supplied client certificate keystore and truststore must already be in PKCS12 format.
As with the server certificate loaded from `spec.solrTLS.pkcs12Secret`, 
you can have the operator restart Solr pods after the client TLS secret updates by setting `spec.solrClientTLS.restartOnTLSSecretUpdate` to `true`.

You may need to increase the timeout for the liveness / readiness probes when using mTLS with a separate client certificate, such as: 
```yaml
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...

  customSolrKubeOptions:
    podOptions:
      livenessProbe:
        timeoutSeconds: 10
      readinessProbe:
        timeoutSeconds: 10
```

You may also use the `spec.solrClientTLS.mountedTLSDir` option to load a pod specific client certificate from a directory mounted by an external agent or CSI driver.  

### Ingress with TLS protected Solr

The Solr operator may create an Ingress for exposing Solr pods externally. When TLS is enabled, the operator adds the following annotation and TLS settings to the Ingress manifest, such as:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS
spec:
  rules:
    ...
  tls:
  - secretName: my-selfsigned-cert-tls
```

If using the mounted TLS Directory option with an Ingress, you will need to inject the ingress with TLS information as well.
The [Ingress TLS Termination section below](#enable-ingress-tls-termination) shows how this can be done when using cert-manager.


### Certificate Renewal and Rolling Restarts

cert-manager automatically handles certificate renewal. From the docs:

> The default duration for all certificates is 90 days and the default renewal windows is 30 days. This means that certificates are considered valid for 3 months and renewal will be attempted within 1 month of expiration.
>          https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/release-0.8/reference/certificates.html

However, this only covers updating the underlying TLS secret and mounted secrets in each Solr pod do get updated on the filesystem, see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#mounted-secrets-are-updated-automatically. 
However, the JVM only reads key and trust stores once during initialization and does not reload them if they change. Thus, we need to recycle the Solr container in each pod to pick up the updated keystore.

The operator tracks the MD5 hash of the `tls.crt` from the TLS secret in an annotation on the StatefulSet pod spec so that when the TLS secret changes, it will trigger a rolling restart of the affected Solr pods.
The operator guards this behavior with an **opt-in** flag `restartOnTLSSecretUpdate` as some users may not want to restart Solr pods when the TLS secret holding the cert changes and may instead choose to restart the pods during a maintenance window (presumably before the certs expire).
```yaml
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...

  solrTLS:
    restartOnTLSSecretUpdate: true
    ...

```

### Misc Config Settings for TLS Enabled Solr

Although not required, we recommend setting the `commonServicePort` and `nodePortOverride` to `443` instead of the default port `80` under `solrAddressability` to avoid confusion when working with `https`. 
```yaml
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...

  solrAddressability:
    commonServicePort: 443
    external:
      nodePortOverride: 443

```

#### Prometheus Exporter

If you're relying on a self-signed certificate (or any certificate that requires importing the CA into the Java trust store) for Solr pods, then the Prometheus Exporter will not be able to make requests for metrics. 
You'll need to duplicate your TLS config from your SolrCloud CRD definition to your Prometheus exporter CRD definition as shown in the example below:
```yaml
  solrReference:
    cloud:
      name: "dev"
    solrTLS:
      restartOnTLSSecretUpdate: true
      keyStorePasswordSecret:
        name: pkcs12-password-secret
        key: password-key
      pkcs12Secret:
        name: dev-selfsigned-cert-tls
        key: keystore.p12
```
_This only applies to the SolrJ client the exporter uses to make requests to your TLS-enabled Solr pods and does not enable HTTPS for the exporter service._

#### Public / Private Domain Names

If your Solr pods use Kubernetes internal domain names, such as `<cloud>-solrcloud-<oridinal>.<ns>` or 
`<cloud>-solrcloud-<oridinal>.<ns>.svc.cluster.local` then you **cannot** request a certificate from a service like LetsEncrypt. 
You'll receive an error like (from the cert-manager controller pod logs):
```
   Cannot issue for \"*.<ns>.svc.cluster.local\": Domain name does not end with a valid public suffix (TLD)"
```
This is policy enforced by trusted certificate authorities, see: https://www.digicert.com/kb/advisories/internal-names.htm.
Intuitively, this makes sense because services like LetsEncrypt cannot determine if you own a private domain because they cannot reach it from the Internet. 

Some CA's provide TLS certificates for private domains but that topic is beyond the scope of the Solr operator.
You may want to use a self-signed certificate for internal traffic and then a public certificate for your Ingress.
Alternatively, you can choose to expose Solr pods with an external name using SolrCloud `solrAddressability` settings:
```yaml
kind: SolrCloud
metadata:
  name: search
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...

  solrAddressability:    
    commonServicePort: 443
    external:
      nodePortOverride: 443
      domainName: k8s.solr.cloud
      method: Ingress
      useExternalAddress: true
```
The example settings above will result in your Solr pods getting names like: `<ns>-search-solrcloud-0.k8s.solr.cloud` 
which you can request TLS certificates from LetsEncrypt assuming you own the `k8s.solr.cloud` domain.

#### mTLS

Mutual TLS (mTLS) provides an additional layer of security by ensuring the client applications sending requests to Solr are trusted.
To enable mTLS, simply set `spec.solrTLS.clientAuth` to either `Want` or `Need`. When mTLS is enabled, the Solr operator needs to
supply a client certificate that is trusted by Solr; the operator makes API calls to Solr to get cluster status. 
To configure the client certificate for the operator, see [Running the Operator > mTLS](../running-the-operator.md#client-auth-for-mtls-enabled-solr-clusters)

When mTLS is enabled, the liveness and readiness probes are configured to execute a local command on each Solr pod instead of the default HTTP Get request.
Using a command is required so that we can use the correct TLS certificate when making an HTTPs call to the probe endpoints.

To help with debugging the TLS handshake between client and server,
you can add the `-Djavax.net.debug=SSL,keymanager,trustmanager,ssl:handshake` Java system property to the `spec.solrOpts` for your SolrCloud instance. 

To verify mTLS is working for your Solr pods, you can supply the client certificate (and CA cert if needed) via curl after opening a port-forward to one of your Solr pods:
```
curl "https://localhost:8983/solr/admin/info/system" -v \
  --key client/private_key.pem \
  --cert client/client.pem \
  --cacert root-ca/root-ca.pem
```
The `--cacert` option supplies the CA's certificate needed to trust the server certificate provided by the Solr pods during TLS handshake.

## Enable Ingress TLS Termination
_Since v0.4.0_

A common approach to securing traffic to your Solr cluster is to perform **TLS termination** at the Ingress and either leave all traffic between Solr pods un-encrypted or use private CAs for inter-pod communication.
The operator supports this paradigm, to ensure all external traffic is encrypted.

```yaml
kind: SolrCloud
metadata:
  name: search
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...

  solrAddressability:
    external:
      domainName: k8s.solr.cloud
      method: Ingress
      hideNodes: true
      useExternalAddress: false
      ingressTLSTermination:
        tlsSecret: my-selfsigned-cert-tls
```

The only additional settings required here are:
- Making sure that you are not using the external TLS address for Solr to communicate internally via `useExternalAddress: false`.
  This will be ignored, even if it is set to `true`.
- Adding a TLS secret through `ingressTLSTermination.tlsSecret`, this is passed to the Kubernetes Ingress to handle the TLS termination.
  _This ensures that the only way to communicate with your Solr cluster externally is through the TLS protected common-endpoint._

To generate a TLS secret, follow the [instructions above](#use-cert-manager-to-issue-the-certificate) and use the templated Hostname: `<namespace>-<name>-solrcloud.<domain>`

If you configure your SolrCloud correctly, cert-manager can auto-inject the TLS secrets for you as well:

```yaml
kind: SolrCloud
metadata:
  name: search
  namespace: explore
spec:
  ... other SolrCloud CRD settings ...
  customSolrKubeOptions:
    ingressOptions:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
        cert-manager.io/issuer: "<issuer-name>"
        cert-manager.io/common-name: explore-search-solrcloud.apple.com
  solrAddressability:
    external:
      domainName: k8s.solr.cloud
      method: Ingress
      hideNodes: true
      useExternalAddress: false
      ingressTLSTermination:
        tlsSecret: myingress-cert
```

For more information on the Ingress TLS Termination options for cert-manager, [refer to the documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/).

## Authentication and Authorization
_Since v0.3.0_

All well-configured Solr clusters should enforce users to authenticate, even for read-only operations. Even if you want
to allow anonymous query requests from unknown users, you should make this explicit using Solr's rule-based authorization
plugin. In other words, always enforce security and then relax constraints as needed for specific endpoints based on your
use case. The Solr operator can bootstrap a default security configuration for your SolrCloud during initialization. As such,
there is no reason to deploy an unsecured SolrCloud cluster when using the Solr operator. In most cases, you'll want to combine
basic authentication with TLS to ensure credentials are never passed in clear text.

For background on Solr security, please refer to the [Reference Guide](https://solr.apache.org/guide) for your version of Solr.

The Solr operator only supports the `Basic` authentication scheme. In general, you have two primary options for configuring authentication with the Solr operator:
1. Let the Solr operator bootstrap the `security.json` to configure *basic authentication* for Solr.
2. Supply your own `security.json` to Solr, which must define a user account that the operator can use to make API requests to secured Solr pods.

If you choose option 2, then you need to provide the credentials the Solr operator should use to make requests to Solr via a Kubernetes secret. 
With option 1, the operator creates a Basic Authentication Secret for you, which contains the username and password for the `k8s-oper` user.

### Option 1: Bootstrap Security

The easiest way to get started with Solr security is to have the operator bootstrap a `security.json` (stored in ZK) as part of the initial deployment process.
To activate this feature, add the following configuration to your SolrCloud CRD definition YAML:
```yaml
spec:
  ...
  solrSecurity:
    authenticationType: Basic
```

Once the cluster is up, you'll need the `admin` user password to login to the Solr Admin UI.
The `admin` user will have a random password generated by the operator during `security.json` bootstrapping.
Use the following command to retrieve the password from the bootstrap secret created by the operator:
```bash
kubectl get secret <CLOUD>-solrcloud-security-bootstrap -o jsonpath='{.data.admin}' | base64 --decode
```
_where `<CLOUD>` is the name of your SolrCloud_

Once `security.json` is bootstrapped, the operator will not update it! You're expected to use the `admin` user to access the Security API to make further changes.
In addition to the `admin` user, the operator defines a `solr` user, which has basic read access to Solr resources. You can retrieve the `solr` user password using:
```bash
kubectl get secret <CLOUD>-solrcloud-security-bootstrap -o jsonpath='{.data.solr}' | base64 --decode
```

You can safely delete the bootstrap secret, provided you've captured the `admin` password, after your SolrCloud deploys with the bootstrapped `security.json`.
However, this will trigger a rolling restart across all pods as the `setup-zk` initContainer definition changes.

#### k8s-oper user

The operator makes requests to secured Solr endpoints as the `k8s-oper` user; credentials for the `k8s-oper` user are stored in a separate secret of type `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`
with name `<CLOUD>-solrcloud-basic-auth`. The `k8s-oper` user is configured with read-only access to a minimal set of endpoints, see details in the **Authorization** sub-section below.
Remember, if you change the `k8s-oper` password using the Solr security API, then you **must** update the secret with the new password or the operator will be locked out.
Also, changing the password for the `k8s-oper` user in the K8s secret after bootstrapping will not update Solr! You're responsible for changing the password in both places.

#### Liveness and Readiness Probes

We recommend configuring Solr to allow un-authenticated access over HTTP to the probe endpoint(s) and the bootstrapped `security.json` does this for you automatically (see next sub-section). 
However, if you want to secure the probe endpoints, then you need to set `probesRequireAuth: true` as shown below:
```yaml
spec:
  ...
  solrSecurity:
    authenticationType: Basic
    probesRequireAuth: true
```
When `probesRequireAuth` is set to `true`, the liveness and readiness probes execute a command instead of using HTTP. 
The operator configures a command instead of setting the `Authorization` header for the HTTP probes, as that would require a restart of all pods if the password changes. 
With a command, we can load the username and password from a secret; Kubernetes will 
[update the mounted secret files](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#mounted-secrets-are-updated-automatically) when the secret changes automatically.

If you customize the HTTP path for any probes (under `spec.customSolrKubeOptions.podOptions`), 
then you must use `probesRequireAuth=false` as the operator does not reconfigure custom HTTP probes to use the command needed to support `probesRequireAuth=true`.

If you're running Solr 8+, then we recommend using the `/admin/info/health` endpoint for your probes using the following config:
```yaml
spec:
  ...
  customSolrKubeOptions:
    podOptions:
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          scheme: HTTP
          path: /solr/admin/info/health
          port: 8983
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          scheme: HTTP
          path: /solr/admin/info/health
          port: 8983
```
Consequently, the bootstrapped `security.json` will include an additional rule to allow access to the `/admin/info/health` endpoint:
```json
      {
        "name": "k8s-probe-1",
        "role": null,
        "collection": null,
        "path": "/admin/info/health"
      }
```

Note, if you change the probes after creating your solrcloud, then the new probe paths will not be added to the security.json.
The security file is bootstrapped just once, so if your probes need to change you must add it to the allowed paths via the Solr Security API using the admin credentials.

#### Authorization

The default `security.json` created by the operator during initialization is shown below; the passwords for each user are randomized for every SolrCloud you create.
In addition to configuring the `solr.BasicAuthPlugin`, the operator initializes a set of authorization rules for the default user accounts: `admin`, `solr`, and `k8s-oper`.
Take a moment to review these authorization rules so that you're aware of the roles and access granted to each user in your cluster.
```json
{
  "authentication": {
    "blockUnknown": false,
    "class": "solr.BasicAuthPlugin",
    "credentials": {
      "admin": "...",
      "k8s-oper": "...",
      "solr": "..."
    },
    "realm": "Solr Basic Auth",
    "forwardCredentials": false
  },
  "authorization": {
    "class": "solr.RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin",
    "user-role": {
      "admin": [ "admin", "k8s" ],
      "k8s-oper": [ "k8s" ],
      "solr": [ "users", "k8s" ]
    },
    "permissions": [
      {
        "name": "k8s-probe-0",
        "role": null,
        "collection": null,
        "path": "/admin/info/system"
      },
      {
        "name": "k8s-status",
        "role": "k8s",
        "collection": null,
        "path": "/admin/collections"
      },
      {
        "name": "k8s-metrics",
        "role": "k8s",
        "collection": null,
        "path": "/admin/metrics"
      },
      { 
         "name": "k8s-zk", 
         "role":"k8s", 
         "collection": null, 
         "path":"/admin/zookeeper/status" 
      },
      {
        "name": "k8s-ping",
        "role": "k8s",
        "collection": "*",
        "path": "/admin/ping"
      },
      {
        "name": "read",
        "role": [ "admin", "users" ]
      },
      {
        "name": "update",
        "role": [ "admin" ]
      },
      {
        "name": "security-read",
        "role": [ "admin" ]
      },
      {
        "name": "security-edit",
        "role": [ "admin" ]
      },
      {
        "name": "all",
        "role": [ "admin" ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
A few aspects of the default `security.json` configuration warrant a closer look. First, the `probesRequireAuth` setting 
(defaults to `false`) governs the value for `blockUnknown` (under `authentication`) and whether the probe endpoint(s) require authentication:
```json
      {
        "name": "k8s-probe-0",
        "role": null,
        "collection": null,
        "path": "/admin/info/system"
      }
``` 
In this case, the `"role":null` indicates this endpoint allows anonymous access by unknown users. 
The `"collection":null` value indicates the path is not associated with any collection, i.e. it is a top-level system path.

The operator sends GET requests to the `/admin/collections` endpoint to get cluster status to determine the rolling restart order:
```json
      {
        "name": "k8s-status",
        "role": "k8s",
        "collection": null,
        "path": "/admin/collections"
      },
``` 
In this case, the `"role":"k8s"` indicates the requesting user must be in the `k8s` role; notice that all default users have the `k8s` role.

The Prometheus exporter sends GET requests to the `/admin/metrics` endpoint to collect metrics from each pod. 
The exporter also hits the `/admin/ping` endpoint for every collection, which requires the following authorization rules:
```json
      {
        "name": "k8s-metrics",
        "role": "k8s",
        "collection": null,
        "path": "/admin/metrics"
      },
      {
        "name": "k8s-ping",
        "role": "k8s",
        "collection": "*",
        "path": "/admin/ping"
      },
      { 
         "name": "k8s-zk", 
         "role":"k8s", 
         "collection": null, 
         "path":"/admin/zookeeper/status" 
      },
```
The `"collection":"*"` setting indicates this path applies to all collections, which maps to endpoint `/collections/<COLL>/admin/ping` at runtime.

The initial authorization config grants the `read` permission to the `users` role, which allows `users` to send query requests but cannot add / update / delete documents.
For instance, the `solr` user is mapped to the `users` role, so the `solr` user can send query requests only. 
In general, please verify the initial authorization rules for each role before sharing user credentials.

### Option 2: User-provided `security.json` and credentials secret

If users want full control over their cluster's security config, then they can provide the Solr `security.json` via a Secret and the credentials the operator should use
to make requests to Solr in a Secret.

#### Custom `security.json` Secret
_Since v0.5.0_

For full control over the Solr security configuration, supply a `security.json` in a Secret. The following example illustrates how to point the operator to a Secret containing a custom `security.json`:

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  solrSecurity:
    authenticationType: Basic
    bootstrapSecurityJson:
      name: my-custom-security-json
      key: security.json
```
For `Basic` authentication, if you don't supply a `security.json` Secret, then the operator assumes you are bootstrapping the security configuration via some other means.

Refer to the example `security.json` shown in the Authorization section above to help you get started crafting your own custom configuration. 

#### Basic Authentication 

For `Basic` authentication, the supplied secret must be of type [Basic Authentication Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#basic-authentication-secret) and define both a `username` and `password`.
 
```yaml
spec:
  ...
  solrSecurity:
    authenticationType: Basic
    basicAuthSecret: user-provided-secret
```

Here is an example of how to define a basic auth secret using YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-basic-auth-secret
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: k8s-oper
  password: Test1234
```
With this config, the operator will make API requests to secured Solr pods as the `k8s-oper` user. 
_Note: be sure to use a stronger password for real deployments_

Users need to ensure their `security.json` contains the user supplied in the `basicAuthSecret` has read access to the following endpoints:
```
/admin/info/system
/admin/info/health
/admin/collections
/admin/metrics
/admin/ping (for collection="*")
/admin/zookeeper/status
```
_Tip: see the authorization rules defined by the default `security.json` as a guide for configuring access for the operator user_

##### Changing the Password

If you change the password for the user configured in your `basicAuthSecret` using the Solr security API, then you **must** update the secret with the new password or the operator will be locked out.
Also, changing the password for this user in the K8s secret will not update Solr! You're responsible for changing the password in both places.

##### Prometheus Exporter with Basic Auth

If you enable basic auth for your SolrCloud cluster, then you need to point the Prometheus exporter at the basic auth secret; 
refer to [Prometheus Exporter with Basic Auth](../solr-prometheus-exporter/README.md#prometheus-exporter-with-basic-auth) for more details.

## Various Runtime Parameters

There are various runtime parameters that allow you to customize the running of your Solr Cloud via the Solr Operator.

### Time to wait for Solr to be killed gracefully
_Since v0.3.0_

The Solr Operator manages the Solr StatefulSet in a way that when a Solr pod needs to be stopped, or deleted, Kubernetes and Solr are on the same page for how long to wait for the process to die gracefully.

The default time given is 60 seconds, before Solr or Kubernetes tries to forcefully stop the Solr process.
You can override this default with the field:

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  customSolrKubeOptions:
    podOptions:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 120
```
