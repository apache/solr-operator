    - kind: added
      description: The default solr.xml now includes the necessary boilerplate to specify additional `sharedLib` and `allowPath` values (via the `solr.sharedLib` and `solr.allowPaths` system properties respectively).  The `metricsEnabled` system property can also be used to toggle Solr's metrics processing (defaults to `true`).  Lastly, the `solr.port.advertise` property can be used to control the port Solr is advertised under in `/live_nodes` and other cluster state.  Users providing their own `solr.xml` should replace any references to the `hostPort` system property with `solr.port.advertise`, as support for the `hostPort` placeholder will be removed in a future release.
