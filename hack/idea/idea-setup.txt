In order to easily run the Solr Operator tests via IDEA (IntelliJ or GoLand), you must install the GinkGo IntelliJ Plugin,
as the test framework is not supported by default in IntelliJ or GoLand.

The plugin can be found here: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17554-ginkgo

There is no need to install Ginkgo yourself, as the plugin documentation tells you.
The "make idea" command does this for you.

The templating of the testing configuration is included in the repo under .run/.
Please do not make changes to this file.
